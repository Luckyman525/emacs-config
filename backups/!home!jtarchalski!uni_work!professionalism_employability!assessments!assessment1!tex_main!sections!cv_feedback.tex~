Feedback given by Nick Stevenson from Unisys (nick.stevenson@unisys.com) \\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feedback I used:}\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Place education section before work experience \\
      Justification: I don't have experience in the field I am applying for, so education is more important \\

    \item Add university to education section \\
      Justification: Tells whoever reads my CV that I am currently studying a course in the field that I am applying for \\

    \item Add modules from university to education section \\
      Justification: Modules from my course provide slightly more granular information about what knowledge an employer can expect me to have \\
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feedback I did not use:} \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Anything relevant outside of university \\
      Justification: I think that this should be used in my cover letter to demonstrate skills and attributes that the employer is looking for \\

    \item Modules from A-levels \\
      Justification: A-Levels are not relevant to the field I am applying in, so they can consist of only the subject and grade \\
  \end{itemize}
