Why?

How do I react to:
- Being confronted with disaster or accident | I comfort individuals

- Being put on the spot | I try to take time to think, but the stress takes over

- Walking into a room full of people | I focus on the people I know, and if there are none, I try not to engage

- Having to make a decision without all the facts | I wait to find out more



--------------------------------

1) Ask people what they think I'm good at and reflect
2) Ask myself what I'm good at
3) Online psychometric assessments
4) Style and preferences
5) Where do I want to be in my career
6) Consider developing and reinforcing new skills (proper learning process)


--------------------------------

Strengths vs Skills

- Skills are learnt through repetiotion and have a "best" way of doing them
  - Coding in a specific language
  - Swimming a specific stroke

- Strengths are things we are naturally good at and don't have to learn (softer character traits)
  - Honesty
  - Curiosity
  - Social intelligence

- ask yourself "am I good at this, do I enjoy it and does it add value?"
