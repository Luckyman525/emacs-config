Feedback:
- Place education section before work experience
-- Justification for using: I don't have experience in the field I am applying for, so education is more important
- Add university to education section
-- Justification for using: Tells whoever reads my CV that I am currently studying a course in the field that I am applying for
- Add modules from university to education section
-- Justification for using: Modules from my course provide slightly more granular information about what knowledge an employer can expect me to have
- Anything outside of university
-- Justification for not using: 
- Modules from A-levels
-- Justification for not using: A-Levels are not relevant to the field I am applying in, so they can consist of only the subject and grade
