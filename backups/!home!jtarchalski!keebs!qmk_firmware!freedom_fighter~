Ohhhh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arms don't let me die,
And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arm don't let me die,


A protest erupts on my TV screen,
And you're waving your banners so high,
Well all that I hear and all that I see,
Just makes me break down and cry,


And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arms don't let me die,
And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arm don't let me die,


Well how many times have you tried to shout,
And how many times did they hear,
Well isn't time that they work things out,
But it's the same thing year after year,


And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arms don't let me die,
And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arm don't let me die,


Well how many heartaches,
How many tears,
How many problems,
How many years,
How many times must you fool us around,
How many kids must you put in the ground,
What price is anger,
What price is pain,
How many murders,
Can you do it again,
Why won't you listen,
why don't you care,
I'm talking to fools,
I ain't going nowhere,


And oh,
Freedom Fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arms don't let me die,
And oh,
Freedom fighter, (freedom fighter)
Lay down your arm don't let me die,
